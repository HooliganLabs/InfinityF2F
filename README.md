# InfinityF2F
Infinity Face to Face app

By Nate Johnson (aka Hooligan Labs)

This app is a tool to help with speed and accuracy with success value calculations for ranged combat in the Infinity tabletop tactics game.

This is a quick project. Better commented code and more features (maybe) coming soon. :)

I chose the MIT license because I wanted to put essentially no restrictions on people looking at and sharing my work. But I would love attribution if you use any of this - even moreso, tell me what you're doing!

This was created in Android Studio for use on Android phones and tablets.

The app is intentially laser-focused on providing game information quickly. This is intended to be used even in tournament settings. There should be minimal "looking at your phone" and maximum actual gaming.
